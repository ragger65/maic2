MAIC-2
======

The Mars Atmosphere-Ice Coupler MAIC-2 is a simple, latitudinal (zonally averaged) model that consists of a set of parameterizations for the surface temperature, the atmospheric water transport and the surface mass balance (condensation minus evaporation) of water ice. It is driven directly by the orbital parameters obliquity, eccentricity and solar longitude of perihelion.
